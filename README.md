# Blank-Space

Blank Space is a social network driven application, with the meme theme
done according to the recommendations of Philipp Lackner, for his "appwars"

the application tries to imcorporate an instagram feel, has it presents the user with a home screen through whitch the user can infinitely scroll 
through images retrieved from a reddid api.
not only can the user scroll through Memes, as he can also select 5 different categories of memes, ranging from random to coding memes.

We were trying to give the best experience we could  with this app, and therefore we didn't limit ourselves to a "feed home page"
with Blank Space the user can also create and add his own memes to the app, and browse through his memes as well as other users meme by selecting
the "Member edits" category.

Still in the mindset of "Member edits" we provided the user with a fresh pick of ready to go famous meme templates for his usage,
as well as the ability to edit any image in Blank Space, share any image in Blank Space, download any image and add to favorities.

with a fragment dedicated to user favorite Memes and Meme templates, we made it easier to share your favorite Memes with your friends.

And we can't talk about friends withouth mentioning the chat feature.
Blank Space allows you to share your thought and ideas in a general group chat, as well as trade private thought in private chat


Me (rColeJnr) and spongycode and eargerly waiting for your likes on our app, and we hope you will stil be around to enjoy the update.
